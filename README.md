### Example 1:

The relevant method is handleRequest(). The argument to this method (AKA the URL link) changes from https://0-0-0-0-4000-la7u0l9j4417a1jeh2jng0k52s.us.edusercontent.com to https://0-0-0-0-4000-la7u0l9j4417a1jeh2jng0k52s.us.edusercontent.com/add-message?s=Hello&user=jpolitz. Simply put, we now have a query, and so the variable fields name and text from my code get updated to jpoliz and Hello, as the query of the URL tells us.

Simply put, we now have a query, and so the variable fields name and text from my code get updated to Ashish and Hello, as the query of the URL tells us.

## PART 3

I learned that the query of the URL is the part of the URL that takes place after the first ? and before the anchor. In the sample links for Part 1 of this lab, the URL queries are s=Hello&user=jpoliz and s=Hello&user=Ashish
